Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future values of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. This project gives the estimation of the price of a companyâ€™s stock based on the history and helps the stakeholders to either invest on the stock or to take away their stock from the company.

Time-series prediction is the concept widely used in many real-world applications such as weather forecasting and financial market prediction. Regression Analysis is a common technique used for prediction. It uses the continuous data in a period of time to predict the result in the next time unit. Many timeseries prediction algorithms have shown their effectiveness in practice.

I have used the traditional machine learning algorithms of regression in this project. They are:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression.

The above mentioned algorithms are used to predict stock prices using historical data. I have visualized the actual close price v/s predicted close price of the stocks for each of the model.
