Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future values of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. This project gives the estimation of the price of a company’s stock based on the history and helps the stakeholders to either invest on the stock or to take away their stock from the company. In this project, only **Open** price is considered for processing.

I have used the machine learning algorithms of regression in this project namely:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression.

The above mentioned algorithms are used to predict stock prices using historical data. I have visualized the actual close price v/s predicted close price of the stocks for each of the model.
